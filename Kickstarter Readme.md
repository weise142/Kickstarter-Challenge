# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

The purpose of this project is to analyze Kickstarter Campaign data to uncover trends and insights of how different factors, such as goal amounts and launch date, influence campaign outcomes. This analysis is presented using graphs to provide Louise with important information at a glance because visual aids assist in uncovering trends in a dataset in a more simple and accessible manner.

### Purpose

Provide Louise with simple, accessible data on Kickstarter campaigns, so she can make informed decisions on goal and timeline to contribute to the success of her play *Fever*.

## Analysis and Challenges

This chart shows us the outcome of a Kickstarter campaign based on the dollar goal set for the campaign. 

This chart illustrates that the most successful campaigns have lower dollar goals assigned and vice versa, meaning the least successful campaigns have the highest dollar goals assigned. Understanding the difference in success rates for money goals in campaigns is important because Kickstarter is all or nothing, meaning if you do not meet your fundraising goal within your set timeline you forfeit all the money pledged. Using the information presented in this graph, Louise should keep her funding goal low, preferrably under $5000, to increase her chances of success.

This Chart shows us the outcome of a Kickstarter campaign, within the Theater parent category, based on the creation date of the campaign.

This chart illustrates that the most successful Theater campaigns are started in May and the least successful Theater campaigns are started in December. Again, this information is important due to Kickstarter's all or nothing funding rules. Louise should use this data, combined with the dollar goal data, and start a campaign with a dollar goal under $5000 in May. By using this data, Louise will increase her chances of creating a successful Kickstarter campaign for her play *Fever*

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

There were a couple of challenges when moving through and analyzing my data. One of the difficulties was that I had split the category/subcategory and added the formulas for my dates when I had the data filtered. It was am minor challenge, but it was causing a "blank" row to be created on my pivot chart. It wasn't until I was looking at my country column and realized I had filters on my data. Once I cleared my data filters, I added the commands to all of my data and my blank row went away in my pivot table. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

The most successful campaigns were started in May and the least sucessful campaigns were started in December. We can also see that along with having the most successful campaigns, the most theater kickstarter campaigns are started in May.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

We can conclude from this chart that the most successful campaigns have lower dollar goals, particularly under $5000. The least successful and the most cancelled campaigns came from the campaigns with the higher dollar goals.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

One limitation of this dataset is that the most recent data is from 2017. To provide better information about current trends means we would need more recent data. 

Although we have over 4,000 campaigns, more theater specific data would provide better understanding of those campaigns

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

Box plot of successfully funded plays, whether that be all countries or specific to the US since that is where Louise is looking to launch

Bar Graph of number of days successful campaigns were open to see potential trends and optimize length of campaign

Bar Graph of number of backers for successful campaigns to see potential trends and potentially tailoring the message to backers
